QT-project

The assignment was to create a game or any software with c++ and optionally QT.
I created a tic tac toe game, where the user can play against a computer AI or a real person.
The game was created in 5 weeks.

android-project

Similarly to the QT-project, the assignment was to create either a game or any software we wanted usin Java SDK.
I created a simple game where the user smashes bugs that try to fly across the screen.
The game also implements a high score functionality, which saves the user's nickname and score using a PHP -interface.
The game was created in 4 weeks.

wordpress-project

In the summer of 2014 I worked on a wordpress -plugin project, where the aim was to create a project management
environment for scrum -projects. The plugin allowed users to create a new site for their project, create tasks,
assign tasks to authorized users, mark their status with #todo #inprogress and #done keywords etc.
